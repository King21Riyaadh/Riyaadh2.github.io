                <p>
                  I'm interested in many differnt areas of bussines. Including but not limited to accounting, economics, data analysis, finance, and technology. One of my biggest and most memorable project was a marketplace simulation. Aside from school I have a couple of hobbies that keep my mind active and lets me learn new skills in my free time. I like to create art in a variety of forms, from simple drawings to canvas paintings to digital art to photography and so on. I have also always been fascinated with tinkering with things, especially cars. From a young age I liked to work with my hands to build things and take things apart.  <span class="highlight">highlighted</span>.

        is a program that simulates a competitve market against other real individuals. During my time in this project I was in a team that was marketing for a high-end bicycle company. My team competed against four other teams that started off with identical companies. We had control over many variables like the quality and price of the bikes as well as how many workers we would hire, development and advertising expenses, which market to market to, number of retail locations and many more. The goal of the simulation to make a profitable company and to try and gain the most amount of market share as possible. At the end of the project, my team and one other were dominating in market share holding roughly 70% of the market together. It was very close competition but when it was over my team came second place. Everyone received a digial badge certificate as proof of being involved in the simulation. Overall it was a fun project that let me apply bussiness concepts and techniques I had learned.

        I have been going to York for a couple of years and I have been enjoying my time there. I know people that attend other univerisitys and the stories I have heard from them make me think that York is a solid school. I like that the campus is very big because when I walk around on it I feel like im part of something grand.

        I mentioned that I do art as a hobbie but when I was younger I only did art in school. I am a sometimes competitve person and art was where it really came out. I felt driven to create the finest piece I could and I took pride in it. Like many artists my talent went unoticed by most until middle-school graduation. I was a awarded a medal to recognize my abilites and my dedication to the craft.

My sister got into photography long before me and purchased many cameras but does not use them often because she does not have a lot of free time. It looked like fun to me and since the cameras were laying around I started using them when I wanted. I have taken hundereds of photos but only recently started to post them on social media. One of my long term goals is to build a following and maybe gain enought skill to provide private photo opts as a service.</p>

          I used to be part in a cross country team for a full year. It was a fun experience that let me bond with others in a team building environment. Our team participated in a couple of large events, running races that were between 4-6 kilometers. Prepairing for the events involved rigorous training every week. I would enjoy being part of a team like that again but without the intense physical requirements that cross country calls for.

          I have always loved gaming. I have heard many differnt perspectives on gaming mainly that it is childish but I think gaming can be for anyone. It is a great way to relax after a long day. I don't play games as much as I used to because of time and because I devoloped more hobbies. Since I am always at my desk I only play games that are accessable on my PC.

          I have always had a strong interest in music. I like having music play in the background whenever I can because it makes any task more enjoyable. I have gone to a couple of concerts, each time it was really outside my comfort zone but I don't regret it going to them at all. I wanted to learn how to play music myself. At some point I got myself a acoustic guitar but it is very difficult to learn how to use it on my own.
